### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I've been developing websites and anything related to the internet for 5 years now.

I'm an average full stack web developer - I can build any website you can think of.

I can also plan and create a plan for your project, do research, find additional people to work with (like if we need a designer, server guy, etc).

For the last year I've been working on an entertainment startup (a platform for publishing gifs, clips, stickers).

Before that I've been working on online booking applications (yclients).

Have experience in developing CRM systems

I'm not interested in simple and easy projects, I prefer to take on the most complex and interesting projects that I can find, because it gives me the opportunity to develop and move forward in programming and development.

If you don't understand the technical terms, you don't have to read any further. Have a great day and don't forget to hire me for your project! :)
